<PRE>Hi!
I see that Schillix can be build on itself and it is great.
But I would like o know few things before i try to install it.

-Does Schillix can use existing ZFS pool (still on 2009.06 version, but
thinking to update to OpenIndiana supported one) so that I can make new
Boot environment inside new ZFS dataset, install Schillix in it and boot
it, like I boot any other OpenSolaris/Illumos based distribution?

-If not, can I install Schillix on ZFS after making new Zpool (on
machine or Virtualbox). I would like to do zfs send after that to
physical machine and make new BE.

-What is current usage case for Scillix , e.g., what it can be used for
in this, present state (0.7.2).
And What are possible future usage cases that are planned by project
administration.

-Is there X server in Schillix, and desktop apps and are they planned in
some future time.

-what package management and update distribution/straegy does Schillix
use when upgrading and distributing new applications etc, and what is
the plan in this?

-What might be the closest development needs/plans in Schillix, e.g.
what eventually new people can/should do in contribution sense.

Oh and not to forget:
I see Schillix is on genunix.com.
What might be the contact, or a person or procedure that might allow
other OpenSolaris based distributions to be presented on genunix? (Like
Openindiana etc). Who should they contact there to get mentioned?


Thank you very much for Schillix and your answers. :)
